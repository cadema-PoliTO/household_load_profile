# (a column vector or morcolumn vector horizotally stacked in a 2d-array) for a 
# 1440 min simulation time, with a resolution (timestep) of 1 min. It returns
# the load profile with a different resolution, that is given as input (from
# 5 min to 60 min), keeping constant the total energy consumed in each time
# interval.
